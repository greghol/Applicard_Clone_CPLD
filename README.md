# Applicard_Clone_CPLD

This is the recreated CPLD project code for the CP/M Z80 Appli-card clone for the Apple II computer. 

**** Note: This CPLD design has not been tested on an Applicard clone card yet. ****

The Appli-card Card clone was developed from the Personal Computer Products, Inc card by Alex Freed and used a Xilinx XC9536(XL) 5V(3.3V)
CPLD for much of the glue logic. This design is for the CPLD which was derrived from the Verilog source provided and the UCF file
derrived from the pinout of the CPLD from the schematic.

The JED file is ready to be burned into the CPLD.
