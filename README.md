# Applicard_Clone_CPLD

This is the recreated CPLD project code for the CP/M Z80 Applicard clone for the Apple II computer. 

The Applicard Card clone was developed from the xyz card by Xxxxx Yyyyy Zzzzzzz and used a Xilinx XC9536(XL) 5V(3.3V)
CPLD. This design for the CPLD was derrived from the Verilog source provided and the UCF file derrived from the pinout
of the CPLD from the schematic.
